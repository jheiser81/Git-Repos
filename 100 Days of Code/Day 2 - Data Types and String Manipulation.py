# **Primitive Data Types**

# **String**

# Strings are just a sequence of characters. In python, they can be enclosed in single or double quotes. 

print("Hello"[0])
# This will print the first character in the string "Hello", which is "H". This uses the subscript operator to access the character at the specified index. 
# In python, the first character in a string always starts at index 0.
